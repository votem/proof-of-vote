Background
----------

Votem Corp is a three year old blockchain-based mobile voting headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. Our point of view is that online and other forms of remote electronic voting have not become a material channel of voting across both private and public sector organizations due to legitimate fears of hacking and the lack of a system that is as easily verifiable as paper-based in-person voting methods.

Our goal is to advance the state of the industry to make online and electronic voting a more viable and complementary channel by collaboratively developing a protocol based on distributed ledger, or blockchain, technology with remote voting methods for voting access points including mobile and online (web-based) methods.

In our effort to create the most comprehensive protocol for verifiable, accessible, secure and transparent elections, we think it’s critical to incorporate the perspective, knowledge, opinion, and experience of the voting public it will ultimately serve.

These collective efforts from election administrators, academics, blockchain enthusiasts, and security experts will challenge, strengthen, and build upon the protocol while fostering a sense of collaboration and transparency in its development. 

Your feedback will push the boundaries of what has been considered for electronic voting and will help us realize the ambitious objective of modernizing democracy.
